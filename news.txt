Title: Priyanka Gandhi, Arvind Kejriwal meet protesting wrestlers at Jantar Mantar, slam Centre for ‘protecting’ WFI chief
Description:
Gandhi, accompanied by Rajya Sabha MP Deepender Hooda, reached the venue in the morning and held a lengthy interaction with Malik and Phogat. Talking to the reporters, she accused the government of shielding Singh and said he is facing serious allegations and should be removed from the post. However, at the same time, she also said she does not have any expectations from the Prime Minister. She said the copy of the FIR filed Friday must be shared with the wrestlers as they do not know what sections of the Indian Penal Code have been applied. “When these girls win medals, all of us tweet. It is said that they are our country’s pride. All the leaders, including me, lavish praises on them but now when they are sitting on the road and seeking to be heard, saying they have been wronged, no one is ready to listen to them,” said Gandhi.

Demanding the ouster of Singh, she said, “Till he is in that post, he will continue to exert pressure and keep destroying people’s career. If that person is there on a post through which he can destroy the careers of the wrestlers, harass them and exert pressure, then what is the meaning of the FIRs and the investigation.”

“Strip him of his powers which had enabled him to do all this,” she said and asked, “I want to understand why the government is protecting him?”

Gandhi further said the government should have protected the wrestlers. “These girls, who have done so much for the country and their homes, you should save them. Instead, they (government) are saving this person (Singh). What does it say about our country if we cannot save our girls?” she asked.
Asked about Prime Minister Narendra Modi, she said, “Had the Prime Minister been concerned, then he would have at least called them and spoken to them. He had called them for tea when they won medals. So, call them (now), talk to them, they are our girls,” she said.

Asked about the oversight panel that investigated the allegations, the Congress general secretary said, “We all know what committees are, they are meant to skirt the issue. Whenever there is exploitation of women, this government goes mute. It is an old story that FIRs are not registered and women have to run from pillar to post.”

“These girls are so brave and courageous and they are standing up and saying that we will not let this happen,” Gandhi said.

Title : Himachal Pradesh & Delhi: With crucial changes at top, BJP looks to rebuild party ground up
Description: Smarting from back-to-back electoral defeats in December 2022 — first in the prestigious municipal corporation elections of Delhi, a first in 15 years, and the Assembly elections in Himachal Pradesh — BJP national president Jagat Prakash Nadda finally swung into action last Sunday. Keeping the 2024 Lok Sabha elections in mind, he effected organisational changes that indicate he could be seeking to be in the driver’s seat on party affairs in both the national capital as well as its British-era summer standby.

Not only was Suresh Kashyap was replaced as the president of the Himachal Pradesh BJP with Dr Rajeev Bindal, Himachal BJP general secretary (organisation) Pavan Rana and his Delhi counterpart Siddharthan swapped roles. 
  “Woh to koi vivad hi nahin tha, woh to koi baat hi nahin thi. Teen din mein hi sab saaf ho gaya tha (That was no controversy, it was nothing. It got clarified within three days),” Bindal told The Indian Express, speaking about the unsavoury incident, in which the accused was suspected to have links with Bindal. “Had there been any trace of truth in those allegations, my seniors would not have reposed faith in me again, nor would I have got a ticket for the last Assembly elections,” he said on Monday, a day after assuming charge.

Before this, Bindal quit as health minister in the Prem Kumar Dhumal government, and then as Assembly Speaker, to take up the post of state BJP president. A five-time MLA, he lost in the 2022 Assembly polls.

Party colleagues call him energetic, while he describes himself as “65-plus”. “The energy comes when we are clear about our goals and then work wholeheartedly to achieve them,” he says.

Soon after his appointment as state BJP chief, he attended back-to-back video conferences on Sunday — one on preparations for the 100th episode of PM Modi’s Mann Ki Baat, the other for the Shimla municipal corporation elections. For Bindal, the biggest challenge will be to secure victory in all four Himachal’s Lok Sabha seats in 2024.The immediate hurdle is the Shimla corporation polls on May 2, for which he claims outgoing state BJP president Suresh Kashyap, 52, has already done the groundwork. “Kashyapji has formulated a good strategy and we are hopeful of putting up a good show,” says Bindal.

For Kashyap, the change in role is dayitva parivartan (change of responsibility). He claims he didn’t resign from his post, merely requested that he be relieved of the responsibility. The Shimla MP stepped down as BJP state president on April 20.

In the other change, Pavan Rana has been brought back to Delhi, while Siddharthan moves to Shimla. Both are considered confidants of the BJP national president. The general secretary (organisation) is a party post unique to the BJP that links its state units with the RSS. Despite the recent defeats in their respective CVs, party insiders interpret the swapping of Rana and Siddharthan as a “forward-looking, rather than vengeful” decision.

Title: Centre Blocks 14 Mobile Messenger Apps In Big Crackdown On Terror Groups 
Description: New Delhi:

In a big crackdown on terrorist activities, the Centre has banned 14 mobile messaging applications which were allegedly being used by terror groups, largely in Jammu and Kashmir, to communicate with their supporters and Over Ground Workers (OGW) and also receive instructions from Pakistan, sources said.

The banned apps include Crypviser, Enigma, Safeswiss, Wickrme, Mediafire, Briar, BChat, Nandbox, Conion, IMO, Element, Second Line, Zangi, and Threema.

The action was taken on the recommendation of security and intelligence agencies. A list of apps that pose a threat to national security and do not follow Indian laws was prepared, and the concerned ministry was informed of the request to ban them. These apps have been blocked under Section 69A of the Information Technology Act, 2000, the official added.
In official communications to higher-ups, the intelligence agencies informed that these apps are spreading terror propaganda in the Valley, ANI said.

"Agencies keep track of channels used by Overground workers (OGWs) and terrorists to communicate among themselves. While tracking down one of the communication, agencies found that the mobile application does not have representatives in India, and it is difficult to track down activities happening on the app," an official told news agency ANI.
